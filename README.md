# 🍽️ Restaurant Data Analysis Project

This repository contains the work completed as part of my **Data Analysis Internship** at **Cognifyz Technologies** (May 2025 – June 2025). The project explores various analytical aspects of a restaurant dataset, including cuisine types, geographic distribution, ratings, and more.

## 📁 Project Structure

```

├── Level_2.ipynb                # Analysis on cuisine combinations, geographic mapping, restaurant chains
├── Level_3.ipynb                # In-depth tasks on votes, service offerings, and price range impact
├── restaurant_map.html          # Interactive map visualization of restaurant locations
```
